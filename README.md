# hh_vacancies_database
This project is all about looking for vacancies published by the employers of your choosing

First, one has to find out what the URLs of the chosen employers on hh.ru are. 
Then, one has to add them to the list of employers in companies.json.
Some companies of the creator of the project's choosing have been added as an example.

Once one's clicked 'run', the program will start uploading database of vacancies published by the employers from companies.json. 

Then one will be given several options:
- To see the number of vacancies the program has been able to find
- To see the average salary of all the vacancies
- To see the vacancies with a higher-than-average salary
- To look for vacancies that contain the keyword one wants the job name to have

If you want to leave feedback, please refer to feedback.about.hh.vacancies.database@likeitsreal.com

Enjoy!
