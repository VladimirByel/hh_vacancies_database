# hh_vacancies_database
This project is all about looking for vacancies published by the employers of your choosing

First, one has to find out what the urls of the chosen employers on hh.ru are. 
Then, one has to add them to the list of employers in companies.json.
Some companies of the creator of the project's choosing have been added as an example.

Once one's clicked 'run', the programm will start uploading database of vacancies published by the employers from companies.josn. 

Then one will be given several options:
- To see the number of vacancies the programm could find
- To see the average salary of all the vacancies
- More is to come

If you want to leave feedback, please refer to feedback.about.hh.vacancies.database@likeitsreal.com
Enjoy!
